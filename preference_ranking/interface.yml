  ## Instructions

  You will be given three outputs generated from a model inferring the conclusion about randomized control trials.
  Each will be labeled output 1, output 2, and output 3. We want to evaluate which model-generated output is the best.
  The criteria to rank these outputs upon are as follows:

  1. Agrement with the reference conclusion (whether there is enough evidence, not enough evidence, etc.)
  2. Whether the output is fluent and sensible
  3. Whether there is irrelevant information that detracts from the conclusion  
   
  Rank the three targets by selecting their rank accordingly. Ranking is ordered 1 for the best output and 3 for the worst output.

  #### Workflow
  Click "Add Edit" > Hit "Output 1", "Output 2", or "Output 3". > Click "Save".

  After, click the edit button (pencil) to edit > Answer the question by selecting a ranking > Hit "Save" to save your selection.

  Do the above for all three edits: "Output 1", "Output 2", and "Output 3".
