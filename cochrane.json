Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone.

The use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.","target":"Output 1: The evidence suggests that corticosteroids, specifically betamethasone and dexamethasone, can stabilize and improve laboratory and clinical parameters in pregnant women with HELLP syndrome. These interventions have been shown to increase maternal platelet count, decrease lactic dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and accelerate recovery. However, the evidence is not conclusive on whether corticosteroids reduce maternal morbidity related to HELLP syndrome or whether they are superior to other interventions such as low dose aspirin. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and determine the optimal corticosteroid dosage and duration for treating HELLP syndrome in pregnancy.\n\nOutput 2: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that corticosteroids, specifically dexamethasone and betamethasone, can improve the outcome of HELLP syndrome in pregnancy by accelerating postpartum recovery and reducing the risk of recurrent exacerbations. However, the studies have varying results, and some do not show significant improvements in laboratory and clinical parameters. Overall, the evidence is strong but more studies are needed to validate the optimal dosage, timing, and long-term effects of corticosteroid therapy in HELLP syndrome.\n\nOutput 3: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that corticosteroids, specifically betamethasone and dexamethasone, can have beneficial effects on HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome in pregnancy. These benefits include accelerated recovery, disease stabilization, and improved laboratory parameters.

Further investigation is needed to assess the efficiency of corticosteroids in management of HELLP syndrome and determine which steroid and dosage is most effective.

However, more randomised clinical trials are needed.","target":"Output 1: The provided articles suggest that radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) is an effective intervention for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with equivalent therapeutic effects, complication rates, and rates of residual foci of untreated disease compared to percutaneous microwave coagulation (PMC) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in some studies. However, RFA can be achieved with fewer sessions than PMC. In another study, RFA was superior to PEI with respect to local recurrence-free survival rates. Cryosurgical ablation, while more effective for larger unresectable HCCs, is associated with higher morbidity. The evidence in the articles is strong enough to support the use of RFA as a viable option for treating HCC, but more studies are needed to further validate its long-term efficacy and safety compared to other interventions.\n\nOutput 2: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) is an effective intervention for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of various sizes and in different patient populations, including those with cirrhosis and colorectal liver metastases. However, the optimal use of RFA compared to other interventions, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI), hepatic resection (HR), and microwave coagulation, remains unclear. More studies are needed to determine the relative advantages and disadvantages of each technique and to establish clear guidelines for their use in clinical practice.\n\nOutput 3: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) is an effective intervention for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of 3 cm or less, with similar or superior outcomes compared to percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) and percutaneous acetic acid injection. However, the evidence is not definitive, and more studies are needed to establish the superiority of RFA over other interventions and to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety. Additionally, the role of RFA in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases is still being investigated, with some studies suggesting it may be equivalent to hepatectomy, while others indicate that hepatectomy is superior. Overall, RFA is a promising intervention for treating HCC and liver metastases, but more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and limitations."},{"source":"This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities.

Data on adverse events are limited. Establishing standard outcomes will help comparisons between studies and better meta-analysis.","target":"Output 1: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that paracetamol has little to no antipyretic benefit over placebo or physical methods such as sponging in treating fever in children. Some studies show a slight reduction in fever with paracetamol, but the difference is not statistically significant. Physical methods, such as sponging, are more effective in reducing fever during the first 30 minutes, while antipyretic medications become more effective after 60 minutes.
