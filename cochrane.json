[{"source":"Long acting inhaled beta-agonists have advantages across a wide range of physiological and clinical outcomes for regular treatment.","target":"Output 1: The evidence suggests that regularly scheduled use of long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) may have deleterious effects on asthma control compared to short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) used only as needed in adults and children with stable asthma. However, a fixed combination of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) has been shown to improve asthma control and reduce exacerbations in children. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may also be beneficial as an adjunct therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma who show little improvement with beta-agonists. Overall, more studies are needed to fully understand the optimal use of beta agonists in asthma treatment.\n\nOutput 2: The evidence suggests that regular treatment with long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) may have deleterious effects on asthma control compared to daily regular treatment with short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) in both adults and children with stable asthma. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and some studies indicate that LABAs added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can improve asthma control. More studies are needed to validate these findings and determine the optimal use of beta agonists in asthma management.\n\nOutput 3: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that both long-acting and short-acting beta agonists have a role in asthma management, but their use varies. Short-acting beta agonists are typically used on an as-needed basis for quick relief of symptoms, while long-acting beta agonists provide continuous bronchodilation and improve asthma control. The studies presented in the articles show that long-acting beta agonists can be effective in reducing symptoms and improving lung function in adults and children with stable asthma, but they may also increase the risk of side effects such as tremors and tachycardia. The evidence is strong enough to support the use of long-acting beta agonists as a regular treatment option for stable asthma, but more studies are needed to fully understand their long-term safety and efficacy. The use of short-acting beta agonists on an as-needed basis remains an important part of asthma management, especially for quick relief of symptoms during exacerbations. Overall, the evidence supports a combination of long-acting and short-acting beta agonists for effective asthma management."},{"source":"In contrast to the previous version of this review, our results suggest that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Because of the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain about the magnitude of the effects on pain relief and function, however. Therapeutic ultrasound is widely used for its potential benefits on both knee pain and function, which may be clinically relevant. Appropriately designed trials of adequate power are therefore warranted.","target":"Output 1: The evidence from the provided snippets suggests that therapeutic ultrasound can be effective in relieving stiffness and pain, increasing soft tissue extensibility, and improving functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

However, the studies do not provide strong evidence for the long-term benefits or safety of this intervention. The use of dexamethasone for pain relief in acute exudative pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis shows short-term pain relief but may not be sufficient for lasting relief.
