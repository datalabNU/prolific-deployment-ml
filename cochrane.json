However, combined therapy with low anticoagulant intensity was ineffective. The ESPRIT trial compared oral anticoagulation therapy (target INR 2.0-3.0) with clopidogrel plus aspirin and found no significant difference in ischemic or hemorrhagic events between the two groups. However, fewer myocardial infarctions and repeat interventions occurred in the antiplatelet therapy group. The evidence is strong enough to support the use of antiplatelet therapy as an alternative to oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in some patients with atrial fibrillation who cannot safely take warfarin. However, more studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in this population.\n\nOutput 2: The evidence from the provided articles suggests that anticoagulant therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy in preventing stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. However, the studies have some limitations, such as the nonrandomized design of one study and the early termination of another study due to clear evidence of superiority of oral anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, more studies are needed to validate these findings and to determine the optimal antithrombotic strategy for this patient population.\n\nOutput 3: The evidence suggests that anticoagulant therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that warfarin and other anticoagulants prevent more than half of the strokes related to atrial fibrillation. Combined antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy has also been effective in reducing vascular events in some studies.

More studies are needed to validate the average effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions and to identify the key components that contribute to their success.\n\nOutput 2: Several studies have investigated workplace pedometer interventions for increasing physical activity. The evidence suggests that these interventions can prompt modest increases in physical activity, with some studies reporting significant improvements in self-reported moderate-to-vigorous activity and daily step counts.

More studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions and to identify strategies for improving retention and long-term adherence.\n\nOutput 3: The articles provide evidence for the effectiveness of workplace interventions using pedometers to increase physical activity. Interventions resulted in significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, weekly steps, and meeting public health recommendations.
